# SpotifyML
This project is recommendation sytem using Spotify Dataset.The purpose of this project is
to predict if a random listener will save a song into his or her liked playlist.I presented some of
the visualization processes to understand data and done some EDA(Exploratory Data
Analysis) so we can select features that are relevant to create a Recommendation System.
